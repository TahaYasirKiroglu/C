## Mortgage Calculator

Calculate the monthly payments of a fixed term mortgage over
given Nth terms at a given interest rate. Also figure out how long it will take the user to pay
back the loan. Add an option for users to select the compounding interval (Monthly or yearly
intervals.)
In this assignment you need to figure out how much money is required for a customer to purchase a
mortgage for a house for example. The interest will be calculated based on a fixed amount. The user
can make a down payment and the amount he/she has to pay should be adjusted based on the down
payment. There will be two options where the user will be reported a monthly amount to pay given
a certain amount of time. The other option is that the user will choose an amount to pay monthly
and you need to calculate how long it will take to pay the loan. The added option is the compound
interval where the customer can make large compound payments at certain intervals. Based on the
schedule of the payment intervals the payment scheme should be updated.
Here is an example. So let's say I want to buy a $350,000 house, but I only have $50,000 saved up.
That means I need a mortgage for $300,000. This is my principal. The bank needs to make money,
so they add on an interest rate.
Example calculations for your assignment
Let's say the bank offered us a $300,000 mortgage, with 4.5% annual interest. Interest is
compounded semi-annually (standard in Canada), and payments are made monthly.
P = principal = 300000
n = total number of payments = 5 years * 12 months/year = 60 payments
i = [r/c + 1] c/f - 1
r = annual interest rate = 4.5% = 4.5/100 = 0.045
c = compounding frequency per year = semi-annually = 2 per year
f = frequency of payments per year = monthly = 12 per year
i = [0.045/2 + 1] 2/12 -1
i = [1.0225] 1/6 -1
i = [1.003715] - 1
i = 0.003715
B = (P *i ) / (1 - (i + 1) -n
B = (300000 * 0.003715) / (1 - (0.003715 + 1) -60
B = 1114.5 / (1 - (1.003715) -60 )
B = 1114.5 / (1 - 0.8005254)
B = 1114.5 / 0.19947
B = 5587.18
Your blended payment (ie. principal + interest) is $5,587.18Your total interest+principal is your blended payment multiplied by the number of payments n :
$5,587.18 x 60 = $335,230.80
Your total interest paid is $335,230.80 - $300,000 = $35,230.80
The interest/principal ratio is $35,230.80/$300,000 = 0.1174
The average interest paid per year is $35,230.80 / 5 years = $7,046.16
The average interest paid per month is $35,230.80 / 60 months = $587.18
The amortization expressed in years is 5 years.
